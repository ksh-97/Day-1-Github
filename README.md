### Brief Introduction of Git & Github
Git is a very popular software which is widely used in the industry for handling projects in highly efficent manner. Since it is free and open source, it is quite popular among students as well. It is basically a distributed version control system which is capable of handling projects ranging from simpler to larger size while not compromising with the speed or performance. So, it keeps track of the changes in codes/files and also who is making what changes.

Github is a platform which is useful in online hosting of version control and software development. It is very efficient and particularly useful in managing the Source Code and version control in a distributed manner. Now, we will go through the following tutorial in order create a sample repository.
